# Pet Pharmacy Website

This project was developed as part of my Web Basics course. It is a simple full-stack web application for a pet pharmacy that lets users view pet medications and manage supplier information.

The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, while the database is handled using **SQLite**. The frontend is created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on clean layout and user-friendly design.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **HTML** â€“ Structure of the web pages  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Frontend interactivity  
- **Node.js** â€“ Backend runtime environment  
- **Express.js** â€“ Web framework for routing and APIs  
- **SQLite** â€“ Lightweight database for storing data  
- **Nodemon** â€“ For automatic server restarts during development  

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Display a list of pet products
- Add and manage supplier data
- RESTful API for backend communication
- Modular code structure for clarity and scalability

This project helped me learn how to connect frontend and backend components and build a working database-powered website from scratch.
